## How to Use This

### Morning (1 minute)
Before you start work, ask yourself:
- What's one question I'll need answered today?
- Can FAITHH answer it?

Write it down. Don't overthink it.

### Evening (1 minute)
At end of day:
- Did FAITHH help with anything?
- What couldn't it do that I wished it could?

Write it down. Be honest.

### Weekly Review (5 minutes)
Every Sunday:
- Look at the week's entries
- What patterns do you see?
- What's the #1 gap to fix?

### 📅 2025-12-05 to 2025-12-06 (Multi-Day Session with Sonnet)

**SESSION TYPE**: NAS Reorganization + Hardware Documentation + Media Server Planning

**MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS**:

**1. NAS Completely Reorganized**:
- Transformed 4-year-old "DaHomies" dump folder (3.6TB) into organized structure
- Created automated migration script that moved everything systematically
- **Freed 794GB** by cleaning recycle bin and caches
- New structure: Personal, Audio, Backups, AI, Archive, Inbox_Sorted
- All shares created and accessible via Tailscale

**2. Hardware Ecosystem Fully Documented** (29KB document):
- All 6 devices mapped with verified specs
- Windows Desktop: Ryzen 9 3900X, RTX 3090 + GTX 1080 Ti, 64GB RAM
- MacBook Pro M1 Pro: 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD
- DS220J NAS: IronWolf Pro 16TB, now organized
- ProLiant Gen8: Xeon E3-1220L v2, 4GB RAM (upgrade path: $130)
- Tailscale IPs documented for all devices

**3. Network Architecture Established**:
- Tailscale mesh connecting: Windows, Mac, Phone, NAS
- Partner setup guide created (awaiting his installation)
- Phone can access Windows FAITHH API remotely

**4. Media Server Plan Created** (Ideas Vault):
- Strategy: Stremio + Torbox Pro (10 slots) for 90% of viewing
- Fallback: Plex on ProLiant for favorites (~2TB library)
- Target users: 10-12 family members
- Cost savings: ~$40/month vs traditional streaming
- Deferred until: FGS income stable

**5. Package Cleanup on NAS**:
- Removed: PHP x3, Node.js x2, Perl, MariaDB, Python2
- Freed: ~800MB
- Kept: Tailscale, File Station, SMB Service, essentials only

**Evening Check**:
- **Did FAITHH help?**: Not directly used, but massive infrastructure built
- **What worked**: Automation scripts saved hours of manual work

### 📅 2025-12-07 (Final Opus Session)

**SESSION TYPE**: Opus Review - Final Documentation + Git Commit

**Work Done**:
- Reviewed all work from Dec 4-6 sessions
- Updated resonance journal with comprehensive entries
- Ensured documentation is complete for handoff
- Prepared for free tier usage strategy

**Key Decision**: Budget constraints mean switching to free tier + FAITHH for daily work. Claude reserved for complex problem solving, new learning, architecture decisions.

**Notes**: Incredible amount accomplished in 3 days:
- Infrastructure: Mac FAITHH, Tailscale network, NAS organization
- Documentation: 66KB+ of comprehensive docs created
- Automation: Scripts for NAS migration, backend management
- Planning: Media server, ProLiant activation roadmap

**FAITHH Usage Strategy Going Forward**:
- Use FAITHH (local, unlimited) for: Daily scaffolding, context recall, code review
- Use Claude free tier for: Complex problems, new learning, strategic planning
- Handoff pattern: End Claude → document key points → FAITHH picks up

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Be honest** - If FAITHH didn't help, say so
2. **Be specific** - "Couldn't explain the reasoning" not "wasn't useful"
3. **Don't skip days** - Even "Didn't use FAITHH today" is useful data
4. **Review weekly** - Patterns only emerge over time
5. **One priority at a time** - Pick the biggest gap each week

---

- Groq API: Fast (~1.5s response times)

**Gap Identified**: 
- Partner info (Thomas, Kevin) exists in DB but retrieval didn't surface it well
- Likely needs the Windows 93K doc database for fuller context

**Evening Check**:
- **Did FAITHH help?**: YES - now has real memory across all AI conversations!
- **What worked**: Semantic search pulls accurate project details, formulas, pricing
- **What's missing**: Some older context (on Windows host, inaccessible until Jan 5-6)
- **Would use again?**: Absolutely - this is the system working as intended

**Files Created**:
- RAG_STRESS_TEST.md - Test queries and scoring guide
- FAITHH_KB_SCHEMA.md - Database schema documentation
- index_conversations.py - Multi-source indexer script

**Architecture Now**:
```
Mac (California) ──Tailscale──► Gen 8 (Oregon)
     │                              ├── Flask Backend :5557
     │                              ├── ChromaDB :8000 (20,665 chunks)
     │                              ├── BGE Embeddings
     └── FAITHH UI ◄────────────────┴── Groq API (cloud)
```

**Notes**: This session transforms FAITHH from a single-machine tool to a distributed system with unified memory across all AI conversations. The "affordable but mighty" philosophy validated again - Gen 8 (old server) + Groq (free tier) + Tailscale (free) = production-quality AI assistant.
