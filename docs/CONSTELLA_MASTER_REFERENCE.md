## 📚 Executive Summary

**Constella** is a civic governance framework oriented around **resonance, dignity, and renewal**. 

✅ **KNOWN**: It provides a "proof-before-scale civic OS" for:
- **Resilient siting** - Thoughtful placement of community infrastructure
- **Healthy homes** - Housing that supports human flourishing  
- **Fair governance** - Decision-making that respects dignity

✅ **KNOWN**: Built on the **Celestial Equilibrium** doctrine as its philosophical foundation.

## 📖 Philosophical Foundation: The Celestial Equilibrium

**Source**: https://github.com/Nightmarejam/celestial-equilibrium  
**Confidence**: ✅ KNOWN (from GitHub)

### The Resonance Gap
✅ **KNOWN**: The misalignment between a person's will (what they need/want) and their world's frequency (what their environment provides). This gap creates friction, loss of meaning, and systemic harm when institutionalized.

**Key insight**: The gap isn't personal failure—it's a signal that systems need adjustment.

### Harmonic Alignment
✅ **KNOWN**: Human flourishing requires coherence across three domains:
- **Body** - Physical health and environment
- **Mind** - Mental clarity and purpose
- **World** - Social and institutional context

### The Role of Dissonance
✅ **KNOWN**: Dissonance is **not an enemy to erase**. It's:
- A natural signal indicating misalignment
- Often creative and generative
- Harmful only when chronic and unresolved

### The Cycle of Restoration
✅ **KNOWN**:
1. **Recognize** the dissonance
2. **Adjust** the environment (not just the person)
3. **Build** micro-resonances (small wins)
4. **Embody** the new alignment
5. **Scale** to community level

### The Human Standard
✅ **KNOWN**: "Judge systems by how they treat those with the weakest resonance."

### The Oath of Resonance
✅ **KNOWN**: "Design structures that reduce the resonance gap before judging performance."

## 🔍 For FAITHH: Self-Improvement Protocol

### When Answering Constella Questions

1. **Check this master reference first**
2. **Note confidence levels** - Be honest about what's known vs. unknown
3. **Search conversation history** for unknown sections
4. **If you find authoritative information**, flag it for master doc update

### Discovery Query Pattern

When a section is marked ❓ UNKNOWN, search conversation history with:
```
Query: [discovery query listed in that section]
Categories: claude_conversation_chunk, claude_conversation
```

### Update Protocol

When FAITHH discovers authoritative information:

1. **Log the discovery**:
```json
{
  "section": "UCF",
  "discovered": "UCF handles compliance verification for...",
  "source": "conversation_chunk_2025-10-15",
  "confidence": "medium",
  "needs_verification": true
}
```

2. **Suggest update** to Jonathan
3. **If verified**, update this document

### Honesty Protocol

If asked about an ❓ UNKNOWN section:
- Say: "Based on the master reference, this is still being documented. Let me search the conversation history..."
- Search with the discovery query
- Report what you find, with confidence level
- Suggest adding to master reference if authoritative
