# Tom Cat Sound LLC — Status Update (December 9, 2025)

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: 2024 Tax Return is LATE

**Form 1065 for 2024 was due March 15, 2025 — it was not filed.**

However, this is manageable:
- 2024 LLC revenue was only **$1,000** (found in Venmo records)
- Combined with expenses, 2024 was almost certainly a **loss**
- You can file late and request **First Time Penalty Abatement**
- Talk to Lisa (SBDC) about this before filing
