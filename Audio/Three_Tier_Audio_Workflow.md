# THREE-TIER AUDIO PRODUCTION WORKFLOW
## Home → Mobile Light → Mobile Professional

---

## **TIER 1: HOME SETUP - UAD Volt 1 (90% of use)**

### **Primary Use Cases:**
- DI guitar writing sessions
- Bass recording with partner 
- Solo songwriting in Luna
- Basic mastering work
- Client feedback sessions

### **Signal Chain:**
```
Guitar/Bass → Volt 1 → Luna → Monitor Mix
                   ↓
              (Optional) BlackHole → OBS → Stream
```

### **Luna Project Templates to Create:**

**DI Guitar Session Template:**
- Track 1: DI Guitar (Volt 1 input)
- Track 2: Amp simulation (plugin)
- Track 3: Processed guitar (for mixing)
- Sends: Reverb, Delay busses
- Master: Basic limiting for monitoring

**Bass Writing Template:**
- Track 1: DI Bass (Volt 1 input)
- Track 2: Bass amp simulation
- Track 3: Sub bass enhancement
- Reference track for tempo/key

**Collaborative Partner Session:**
- Set up SonosBus for partner's audio
- Local recording via Volt 1
- Sync markers for easy alignment
- Export stems for partner mixing

### **Workflow Steps:**

**Pre-Session (2 minutes):**
1. Connect Volt 1 to MacBook Pro
2. Open Luna project template
3. Set buffer size: 256 samples (balance latency/stability)
4. Test direct monitoring via Volt 1

**During Session:**
1. Record DI signal clean (no effects)
2. Monitor through amp sims for inspiration
3. Use Luna's built-in tuner
4. Save project states frequently

**Post-Session Sharing:**
- Export DI stems (24-bit/48kHz WAV)
- Export processed mix for partner reference
- Share via secure cloud link
- Document session notes in project

### **File Organization:**
```
~/AudioProjects/
  ├── 2025_Sessions/
  │   ├── ProjectName_YYYYMMDD/
  │   │   ├── Raw_DI/
  │   │   ├── Processed/
  │   │   ├── Stems_Export/
  │   │   └── Session_Notes.md
```

## **TIER 2: MOBILE LIGHT - Software Only**

### **Primary Use Cases:**
- Travel mastering review
- Client feedback during travel
- Emergency recording ideas
- Educational content creation

### **Software Chain:**
```
MacBook Internal → Audio Hijack → Recording/Stream
                      ↓
                 Voice memos for ideas
```

### **Essential Apps for Mobile:**
- **Audio Hijack** - Professional audio routing and recording
- **Luna** - Main DAW (works great on M1 MacBook Pro)
- **Voice Memos** - Quick idea capture
- **Dropbox/Google Drive** - File sharing with clients

### **Mobile Mastering Workflow:**

**Client Review Session:**
1. Open master in Luna
2. Set up Audio Hijack for system audio capture
3. Use built-in mic for commentary
4. Screen share + audio stream to client
5. Take notes in real-time
6. Export marked-up audio for revisions

**Travel Mastering:**
1. Use high-quality headphones (essential!)
2. Work in Luna with software plugins only
3. Export multiple master versions
4. Send via secure link for client approval
5. Document all changes for home studio refinement

**Emergency Idea Capture:**
- Voice Memos for lyrical ideas
- Luna quick projects for chord progressions
- Audio Hijack to capture external audio inspiration

### **Quality Expectations:**
- **Sufficient for:** Client communication, rough mixes, idea development
- **Not suitable for:** Final mastering, critical listening, professional delivery
- **Sweet spot:** Feedback sessions, travel reviews, creative writing

## **TIER 3: MOBILE PROFESSIONAL - Gator Case Setup**

### **Future Equipment Configuration:**
- **Gator Case** - 6 preamps capacity + PreSonus Studio 1810c
- **Full drum recording capability**
- **Multi-instrument sessions**
- **Location recording projects**

### **Planned Signal Chain:**
```
Drums (8 mics) → PreSonus 1810c → Luna (18 inputs)
DI Bass        ↗                      ↓
Guitar Amp    ↗                   Full Mix + Stems
```

### **Development Timeline:**
**Phase 1 (Now):** Master Tier 1 + 2 workflows
**Phase 2 (3-6 months):** Plan Gator case configuration
**Phase 3 (6-12 months):** Build mobile professional rig
**Phase 4 (1 year+):** Deploy for client location sessions

### **Case Configuration Planning:**
- PreSonus Studio 1810c (main interface)
- 6 high-quality preamps for drum overhead/room mics
- Cable management system
- Shock-mounted laptop shelf
- Power distribution
- Backup storage drives
