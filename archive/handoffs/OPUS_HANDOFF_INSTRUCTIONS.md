# How to Use the Opus Handoff - Quick Guide
**For**: Jonathan  
**Purpose**: Get Opus to review Constella + improve FAITHH

---

## 🎯 What You're Getting

Opus will do TWO things:
1. **Deep dive** into your Constella Framework (comprehensive analysis)
2. **Diagnose & fix** why FAITHH struggles with complex projects

---

## 📋 What to Do

### Step 1: Start New Conversation with Opus 4.5
Switch to Opus model in Claude

### Step 2: Upload These Files
Attach to the conversation:
1. `OPUS_HANDOFF_CONSTELLA_2025-11-25.md` (the main handoff)
2. `docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md` (how FAITHH works)
3. `ARCHITECTURE.md` (FAITHH architecture)
4. `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` (optional context)

**Location**: All in `~/ai-stack/`

### Step 3: Say This (or similar):
```
Hi Opus, I need your help with a dual-objective analysis:

1. Deep dive review of my Constella Framework (civic governance project)
2. Figure out why FAITHH struggles to understand it despite 91k documents

I've prepared a comprehensive handoff document that explains both 
objectives, the problem, and what I need from you.

Please review the attached OPUS_HANDOFF_CONSTELLA_2025-11-25.md 
and let me know if you need any clarification before diving in.

GitHub: https://github.com/Nightmarejam/constella-framework
```

### Step 4: Answer Any Questions
Opus might ask:
- Clarifying questions about Constella
- Questions about FAITHH's behavior
- Trade-off decisions (Solution A vs Solution B)

### Step 5: Get Deliverables
Opus should provide:
- **Constella Analysis** (what it is, how it works, recommendations)
- **FAITHH Enhancement Blueprint** (diagnosis + solution + implementation plan)
- **Tasks for Sonnet** (what to build next)

---

## ⏱️ Time Estimate

**Opus Analysis**: 2-4 hours (Opus does this)  
**Your Time**: 30-60 minutes (answering questions, reviewing results)  
**Sonnet Implementation**: 6-10 hours later (after you approve the plan)

---

## 💡 Tips

1. **Be Available**: Opus might need clarifications about Constella
2. **Share Examples**: If Opus asks how FAITHH responds, show actual examples
3. **Decide Priorities**: Opus might present multiple solutions - pick what matters most
4. **Don't Rush**: Let Opus take the time to analyze thoroughly

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

### Opus is Confused About Constella
- Share more GitHub links

After this Opus session:
✅ You understand your own project better (Opus explains it back to you)

✅ You have a clear plan to fix it  
✅ Sonnet has tasks ready to execute  

---

## 🔄 After Opus is Done

Come back to Sonnet (me) and:
1. Share the Opus output documents
2. Confirm which solution to implement
3. I'll execute the implementation plan
4. We'll test and validate improvements

## 📝 Questions?

If you're not sure about:
- **What to tell Opus**: Just share the handoff doc, it's comprehensive
- **How much detail**: The handoff has everything Opus needs
- **What if GitHub is private**: Opus can only see what's public, you may need to summarize private docs

---

**Ready to go!** Just upload the handoff doc to a new Opus conversation and let it work its magic.
