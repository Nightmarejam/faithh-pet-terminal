# Session Summary - 2025-11-29

## ✅ Accomplished Tonight

### Tasks Complete:
1. ✅ **Task 1** - Constella Understanding (3★ → 5★)
   - Added constella_awareness to faithh_memory.json v2.2
   - No more "RAG = Risk/Action/Goal" hallucinations
   - Civic governance understanding perfect

2. ✅ **Task 2** - RAG Priority Tuning (3★ → 5★)
   - Orientation queries skip old RAG, use scaffolding only
   - "Where was I?" queries work perfectly

3. ✅ **Option A.5** - Image Generation Knowledge Fix
   - Added Image_Generation project to memory
   - FAITHH knows to admit "I don't have location info" instead of hallucinating

4. ✅ **Option B** - Journal Entry & Documentation
   - Complete journal entry for resonance_journal.md
   - Testing system vision documented
   - Test session template created

5. ✅ **Planning Documents Created**:
   - `WEEKLY_PLAN_2025-11-29.md` - Usage plan for rest of week
   - `CONVERSATIONAL_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md` - Full 4-phase upgrade path
   - `project_states.json` updated with today's progress
   - `faithh_memory.json` updated to v2.2

### Test Results:
- **6 tests run**, average: **4.58 stars** (up from 1.7★ baseline)
- **5/6 perfect** (5 stars), 1/6 gap found (knowledge boundaries)
- **83% success rate** at 4.5+ stars

### Key Insight:
**FAITHH has a conversational gap** - excellent at retrieval, but can't:
- Generate code
- Multi-turn conversations
- Brainstorm/explore
- Feel like talking to Claude

**This blocks natural usage.** Jonathan won't reach for FAITHH until it feels conversational.

## 🎯 Next Steps

### This Week (Before Usage Reset):
1. **Copy journal entry** from JOURNAL_ENTRY_2025-11-29.md into resonance_journal.md
2. **Test with 1-2 real questions** - Constella or audio work
3. **Validate conversational gap** - Does FAITHH feel limited vs. Claude?
4. **Log findings** in resonance journal

### Next Sonnet Session:
1. **Build Phase 1** - Conversation Memory (3-4 hours)
2. **Test multi-turn** - Can FAITHH remember conversation context?
3. **Validate improvement** - Does it feel more conversational?
4. **Decide**: Continue to Phase 2 or adjust approach?

### Deferred:
- Task 3 (Layers 2-3) - Paused until conversational baseline achieved
- Task 4 (Gemini API key) - Low priority note

## 📊 Usage Estimate

**Tonight's Usage**: ~17% (started with ~100%, have ~83% remaining)

**Remaining Plan**:
- Copy journal entry: 1%
- Real usage test: 5-10%
- **Buffer for variables**: ~70%

**Good cushion for unexpected needs this week.**

---

## 🎉 Success Metrics

- ✅ Tasks 1-2 validated at 4.58★ average
- ✅ All core integrations working (5/6 tests perfect)
- ✅ Conversational gap identified and documented
- ✅ Clear path forward (4-phase enhancement)
- ✅ Project states current
- ✅ Memory updated

**Huge progress tonight!**

## 💡 Key Takeaway

**The gap isn't in retrieval quality (4.58★ is excellent).**  
**The gap is in conversational feel (can't code, can't brainstorm, can't dialogue).**

**Until FAITHH feels conversational, Jonathan won't naturally use it over Claude.**

**Next priority: Build Phase 1 (Conversation Memory) to validate this hypothesis.**
