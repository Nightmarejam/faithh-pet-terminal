## 🎯 URGENT - Income & Work

**Status**: Applications going out, need remote work soon  
**Goal**: Make a couple hundred extra bucks with remote work capacity  

### Questions:
1. **What can this machine (FAITHH/AI setup) do for money?**
   - Is there a service I can offer with my AI/RAG capabilities?
   - Consulting? Custom AI setups for others?
   - Content generation/research services?

2. **Audio production business development**
   - Current model: Review Instagram profiles, meet at cafes or direct communication with talent
   - Mix engineer partner has M2 Mac Mini + Luna DAW
   - Need: Better client pipeline, more consistent income
   - Question: How do high-end remote collaboration services structure their offerings?

3. **Advertising/marketing for services**
   - Feel like income will come from good advertising
   - But: "A lot will go into the process I think?"
   - Need: Understand what marketing actually requires for audio/AI services

## 🎧 ACTIVE - Audio Production & Remote Collaboration

**Current State**: 
- Able to deliver raw WAV files from DAW
- Partner workflow: Review talent → meet/communicate → deliver
- Remote setup exists but not optimized

### Technical Setup Issues:
1. **JackTrip vs SonoBus**
   - JackTrip: Better audio quality BUT stutters without ethernet dock
   - SonoBus: Fallback, works but lower quality
   - **Blocker**: Need dock with ethernet adapter
   - **Question**: Worth investing in dock? What are alternatives?

2. **Remote collaboration workflow**
   - Current: No clients need DI session work yet
   - Desired: Me + partner work on rough drafts for songs online
   - **Question**: What do high-end remote collaboration services offer that we could adapt?
   - **Question**: How to structure remote sessions for song drafting?

3. **WaveLab setup**
   - Status: ✅ Fully functional, saved chains ready to go
   - No current questions here

## 🏛️ UNCERTAIN - Constella Purpose & Direction

**Current State**: 1,904 documents, v1.5.4, documentation phase  
**Emotional State**: "I am not sure what I am doing with it at all"  

### Background:
- Started as: Journaling activity, putting thoughts into AI to validate intuition
- Became: Internalized framework for how the world should run
- Current: "Would be fun to build so people have an idea of how I visualize everything should be"

### Core Uncertainty:
> "I really don't know the purpose behind why I am doing it. I don't really have anything that I am trying to get done."

### Desired:
- **Brainstorm overall goal** for Constella
- **Route to develop some sort of structure**
- **Deeper repository dive** (waiting for Opus 4.5 usage)

### Blockers (Technical):
- Facilitator load caps need definition
- Tie-break protocol needs refinement

**Priority**: LOW until purpose clarifies. Hold technical work until vision is clear.

**Key Question**: Is Constella a personal philosophy journal, a shareable framework, a pilot program, or something else?

## 🧭 ACTIVE - FAITHH Development & Usage

**Current State**: Tasks 1-2 complete (4.58★ avg), conversational gap identified  
**Next**: Phase 1 Conversation Memory implementation

### File Organization Confusion:
> "When you create something and add it to the ai-stack, I get a little confused as to where to put the file or code you just created."

**Problem**: 
- Sometimes clear where files go
- Other times: "I don't know where they would go"
- Need: Visual map of structure

**Solution Needed**:
- File organization guide
- Visual/text map of ai-stack
- Decision tree: "If it's X type of file, put it in Y location"

### Documentation Tracking Confusion:
> "See I think that having a lot to keep track of is getting me confused about what documents I could already have in place."

**Problem**: Multiple docs, unsure what exists already  
**Need**: Master index or catalog of all tracking documents

### Conversation Continuity:
> "Or you can make a protocol to figure out what index you left off at and what were at now? Or is that some other document?"

**Question**: How to hand off context between Claude AI sessions and FAITHH?  
**Need**: Protocol for session continuity

### Metaphor Need:
> "As much as I want a compass, I suppose I will also need a map of some sort."

**Insight**: Compass = direction. Map = structure/layout.  
**FAITHH needs both**: Directional guidance AND structural awareness.

## 🗺️ DOCUMENTATION NEEDS

### 1. AI-Stack File Structure Map
**Status**: NEEDED  
**Why**: Confusion about where to put new files  
**Caution**: "Can get messy fast, don't want to go overboard with design"

### 2. Document Index/Catalog
**Status**: NEEDED  
**Why**: "Confused about what documents I could already have in place"  
**Content**: List of all tracking docs and their purposes

### 3. Session Continuity Protocol
**Status**: NEEDED  
**Why**: Hand off between Claude sessions and FAITHH  
**Content**: How to track where conversation left off

## 💰 INCOME STRATEGY UNCERTAINTY

**Current Reality**:
- Applications going out
- Things "barely working at full capacity"
- Expect issues when connecting to services
- Don't know what this machine can do for money
- Feel income comes from advertising but unsure of process

**Core Question**: What's the actual path to income with current capabilities?

**Options to Explore**:
1. Audio production services (current, needs better marketing)
2. AI/RAG consulting or custom setups for others
3. Content generation/research services
4. Remote collaboration facilitation
5. Something else entirely?

**Action Needed**: Brainstorm concrete service offerings and pricing

## 📋 SUMMARY - Top 3 Priorities

Based on urgency and impact:

### 1. INCOME PATH (URGENT)
- Need: Figure out monetizable services with current capabilities
- Timeline: Applications going out now, need clarity soon
- Next Step: Brainstorm service offerings + pricing research

### 2. FILE ORGANIZATION MAP (HIGH VALUE)
- Need: Clear guide for where files go in ai-stack
- Impact: Reduces cognitive load, enables faster development
- Next Step: Create ai-stack structure map (simple, not overdesigned)

### 3. CONSTELLA PURPOSE (DEFER)
- Need: Clarify why building it and what it's for
- Impact: High once clear, but can wait
- Next Step: Wait for Opus 4.5 usage, do deep repository dive
