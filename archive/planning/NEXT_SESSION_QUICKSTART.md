## 🎯 What to Do When You Open Next Session

### Step 1: Upload the Handoff
Attach this file to your new Sonnet conversation:
```
~/ai-stack/OPUS_TO_SONNET_HANDOFF_2025-11-26.md
```

### Step 2: Say This (or similar):
```
Hi Sonnet,

I'm continuing work on FAITHH from an Opus session. 
I've attached the handoff document that explains:

1. What technical work got done (Constella indexing)
2. What I realized about FAITHH's real purpose
3. What needs to happen next

Please read the handoff and let me know:
- What you think the priority should be
- Any questions you have about the vision
- Where we should start today

Key thing to know: FAITHH isn't just a search tool. 
It's meant to be a thought partner that helps me 
maintain coherence across projects when my attention shifts.
```

### Step 3: Answer Sonnet's Questions
Sonnet will likely ask about:
- Which project needs help most? (FAITHH, Constella, audio business?)
- What's one task you do weekly that FAITHH should help with?
- What does "working" FAITHH look like in your daily life?

Be honest - paint the picture of how you imagine using it.

## 📊 Current System State

**ChromaDB**: 93,533 documents  
**Constella docs**: 1,904 indexed with proper metadata  
**Backend**: Running on port 5557  
**Status**: ✅ Functional, answers Constella questions accurately  

**Test it**: Open FAITHH UI and ask:
- "What is the Astris decay formula?"
- "What are the Evidence Levels?"
- "Tell me about the Penumbra Accord"

All should get accurate answers now.

## 🎯 What Sonnet Should Build First

Based on the handoff, Sonnet should create:

1. **R1 Test Script** (automated functional checks)
   - Does backend start?
   - Does ChromaDB connect?
   - Does RAG work?
   - Takes 1 minute to run

2. **Resonance Journal Template**
   - Daily check-in format
   - Morning: "What do I need today?"
   - Evening: "Did FAITHH help?"

3. **Hero Workflow**
   - Pick ONE task FAITHH should excel at
   - Build specifically for that
   - Example: "When returning to a project, what was I working on and why?"

## 💡 Remember the Vision

From your own words tonight:

> "An AI that will help me build my personal vision and help try to facilitate the image while I work the backend."

FAITHH's job is to:
- **Remember the "why"** when you lose sight of it
- **Surface relevant context** when you return to a project
- **Gently challenge** while accepting incremental progress
- **Help you see connections** across your projects

Not just answer questions. Maintain your harmonic alignment.

## 📁 Files Sonnet Should Review

**Priority**:
- `OPUS_TO_SONNET_HANDOFF_2025-11-26.md` (this handoff)
- `faithh_memory.json` (your profile)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` (system design)

**Reference**:
- `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` (planned work)
- `docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md` (system guide)
- `OPUS_REVIEW_LOG.md` (past decisions)

## 🤔 Questions to Think About Before Next Session

You don't need answers right now, but consider:

1. **Which of your projects do you most struggle to maintain continuity on?**
   - Is it Constella (long development arc)?
   - Is it your audio business (client tracking, follow-ups)?
   - Is it FAITHH itself (meta, but valid)?

2. **What's one unfinished thing that you stopped because you lost sight of "why"?**
   - This is the test case
   - What would have helped you stay connected to it?

3. **Imagine FAITHH working perfectly. What does a typical day look like?**
   - When do you open it?
   - What does it tell you?
   - How does it help?

## ⚡ Quick Wins to Request

If you just want to make progress without deep strategy:

**Ask Sonnet to**:
1. "Create the R1 test script so I can verify FAITHH is healthy"
2. "Set up a resonance journal template for daily check-ins"
3. "Help me define one 'hero workflow' FAITHH should be great at"

These are concrete, achievable, and move toward the vision.
